  <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Vinay's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  <p>
    I started my coding journey as a naive computer science student with a passion to learn everything I could about this programming world - code, theory. 
    And all the while, teaching myself video editing with a dream to make my own film, but that soon got overshadowed by my desire to excel in Web Development.
    However, I had another desire I had been pursuing throughout this time - YouTube content creation. I eventually ended up quitting my YouTube full-time career 
    in 2021 due to college. But that's always bothered me about my journey - abandoning my dream of making videos on YouTube.
  </p>
  <p>
    I have a burning desire to get back on the horse, and fulfill that dream younger me had of making videos and creating content. And in order to do that, 
    I'll be implementing a few measures to focus more time on fulfilling that dream - a dream that I'll be ready to tackle in the future.
